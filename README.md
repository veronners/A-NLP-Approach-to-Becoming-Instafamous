# A NLP Approach to Becoming Instafamous

Text and Multimedia Mining project at Radboud University.

## Abstract:
In a world were people earn money by being successful on social media platforms, NLP can offer a scientific perspective into this success. Can we find the perfect equation to being popular on social media platforms like Instagram? In this research we measure the influence of sentiment and hashtags on the popularity of Instagram posts. No significant correlation between the sentiment of a post caption and the number of likes was found. However, a significant weak negative correlation was found between the number of hashtags and the number of likes. For future research, it would be interesting to look at visual sentiment instead of textual sentiment because Instagram is a visual based platform.
